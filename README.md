# cff: a concurrency toolkit for Go

cff (pronounce *caff* as in caffeine) is a library and code generator for Go
that makes it easy to write concurrent code in Go.

See our documentation at https://uber-go.github.io/cff for more information.

## Project status

At Uber, we've been using cff in production for several years.
We're confident in the stability of its core functionality.

Although its APIs have satisfied a majority of our needs,
we expect to add or modify some of these once the project is public.

That said, we intend to make these changes in compliance with
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
